      "Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\n",
      "thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\n",
      "in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's\n",
      "fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\n",
      "the deficiency of his.\n",

      "She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to\n",

      "The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\n",

      "thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and\n",
      "to a milliner's shop just over the way.\n",
      "The two youngest of the family,\n",
      "Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;\n",
      "their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing\n",
      "better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\n",
      "hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news\n",
      "the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some\n",
      "from their aunt.\n",
      "At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with\n",
      "news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the\n",

      "Every day added something to their knowledge\n",
      "of the officers' names and connections.\n",
      "Their lodgings were not long a\n",
      "secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.\n",
      "Mr.\n",
      "Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of\n",
      "felicity unknown before.\n",
      "They could talk of nothing but officers; and\n",
      "Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation\n",
      "to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the\n",

      "I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my\n",
      "heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,\n",
      "should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought\n",

      "The former was divided between admiration of the\n",

      "for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.\n",
      "She was not equal,\n",

      "before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\n",
      "mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and\n",
      "seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\n",

      "she was still dear to him.\n",
      "Perhaps he had been civil only because he\n",

      "They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,\n",
      "ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of\n",
      "the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the\n",
      "valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading\n",
      "many, and occasionally part of the stream.\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\n",

      "to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\n",
      "They crossed\n",
      "it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;\n",
      "it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the\n",
      "valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\n",
      "and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the\n",
      "bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\n",
      "who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only\n",
      "of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.\n",
      "Her niece was,\n",
      "therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\n",
      "on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\n",
      "progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\n",
      "taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\n",
      "occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the\n",
      "man about them, that he advanced but little.\n",
      "Whilst wandering on in this\n",
      "slow manner, they were again surprised, and\n",
      "Elizabeth's astonishment\n",
      "was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\n",
      "approaching them, and at no great distance.\n",
      "The walk being here\n",
      "less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\n",
      "they met.\n",
      "Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared\n",
      "for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\n",
      "calmness, if he really intended to meet them.\n",
      "For a few moments, indeed,\n",
      "she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.\n",
      "The idea\n",
      "lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\n",
      "turning past, he was immediately before them.\n",
      "With a glance, she saw\n",
      "that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\n",
      "politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;\n",
      "but she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when\n",
      "some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of\n",
      "Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed.\n",
      "Her colour changed,\n",
      "and she said no more.\n",
      "\n",

      "it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\n",
      "could from such disgraceful companions.\n",
      "That he was _\n",
      "surprised_ by the\n",
      "connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and\n",

      "conversation with Mr. Gardiner.\n",
      "Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\n",
      "could not but triumph.\n",
      "It was consoling that he should know she had\n",

      "to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\n",
      "the stream where there was usually most sport.\n",
